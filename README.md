### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I am a Software Engineer in Training
I have been studying python as a part of the Hyperion bootcamp with the hopes of getting a job as a software engineer. 
I will be uploading projects I'm creating to help expand my knowledge.
I would like to progress towards the back end of software engineering with the handling and storing of data, while
also making it fast and secure to use.
